Since the puppet provisioner will fail if the path provided to "puppet.modules"
doesn't exist and librarian-puppet will destroy and recreate the modules
directory on each run, the vagrant-librarian-puppet plugin supports a
placeholder file within the modules directory that can be checked into version
control and will persist between provisions.

This is that file.
